# Slide Puzzle AI Solver

This project is an AI-based solver for the classic slide puzzle game, using the A* algorithm to find optimal solutions. The solver accepts a puzzle formation as input and allows for precision control, letting users balance between speed and accuracy in the solution process.

&nbsp;

## Usage
1. Define the 3x3 puzzle formation as an input:

```python

initial = [
    [6, 7, 3],
    [8, "",5],
    [4, 2, 1],
]  # Use "" to represent the empty space


```
&nbsp;

2. control the precision and how optimal is the solution, higher precision = more time
```python 
# making this variable smaller, makes precision better but more time
precision = 10 
```
